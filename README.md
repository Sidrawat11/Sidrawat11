**`Software Developer and Engineer`**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a software developer and engineer with a passion for learning and building new things. I enjoy working with a variety of languages and technologies, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I am currently a student at Arizona State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering. I am currently working on a few projects that I hope to share soon. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect!
